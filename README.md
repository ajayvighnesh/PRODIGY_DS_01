# NET MIGRATION DYNAMICS: A GLOBAL OVERVIEW

The aim of this project is to analyze global net migration trends over the period from 2000 to 2023, using data sourced from the World Bank. Net migration refers to the difference between the number of immigrants and emigrants for each country. Understanding these patterns can shed light on social, economic, and political factors affecting population dynamics. The project will focus on identifying key trends (inflows/outflows), visualizing migration patterns and highlighting potential factors influencing migration. 

The dataset is formed by merging two World Bank datasets. One dataset contains net migration data, while the other includes region and income group classifications for each country. Net migration measures the difference between the number of immigrants and emigrants over a given period. A positive value indicates more people moving into the country than leaving, while a negative value suggests more people are leaving. The dataset spans from 2000 to 2023, covering over 200 countries, reflecting global population movements influenced by factors such as economic conditions, wars, and policy changes. The merging of these two datasets ensures that each country's migration trends can be analyzed not only in terms of raw net migration values but also in relation to their geographic region and income level classification.
