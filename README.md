# NET MIGRATION DYNAMICS: A GLOBAL OVERVIEW

## ANALYZING AND VISUALIZING GLOBAL NET MIGRATION TRENDS (2000-2023)
### PROBLEM DEFINITION
The aim of this project is to analyze global net migration trends over the period from 2000 to 2023, using data sourced from the World Bank. Net migration refers to the difference between the number of immigrants and emigrants for each country. Understanding these patterns can shed light on social, economic, and political factors affecting population dynamics.
